/works/OL1000782W	Chain Letter	|They all shared the same secret...now they would share the same terror

When Alison first read the chain letter signed 'Your Caretaker', she thought it was some terrible sick joke. Someone, somewhere knew about that awful night when she and six other friends committed an unthinkable crime in the desolate California desert. And now that person was determined to make them pay for it.

One by one, the chain letter came to each of them... demanding dangerous, impossible deeds... threatening violence if the demands were not met.

No one out of the seven wanted to believe that this nightmare was really happening to them.

Until the accidents started happening - and the dying...|	{"authors": ["/authors/OL92956A"], "subjects": ["Mystery fiction", "horror tales", "horror fiction", "juvenile fiction", "Juvenile works", "fiction", "mental illness", "loneliness", "letters", "secrets", "American Young adult fiction", "Horror tales", "Children's fiction", "Horror stories", "California, fiction"], "covers": [8567467, 10374565, 3183301, -1]}

Lorna is the sort of woman people come to when in trouble, and young Nicholas Saracen does this. Nicholas is deeply in love with Lorna's young Spanish neighbor. Yet the thought of his arrival fills Lorna with a strange and tremulous expectancy... Before long the Casa is overflowing with types: Stephanie, better known as somebody's daughter; Martin, whose favorite pastime is making artificial gardens; Roderick, Lorna's former husband who is determined to marry her again. Strangely, some local smuggling eases the path of true love and adds a fine flourish to the conclusion of a charmingly frivolous novel.

Now, at last, she was of age and due to gain her inheritance and be free to choose. A dinner party had been arranged at the Heriot’s home, ‘The Hermitage’ and Hugh expects to be able to announce their engagement. Things start to change after a gruesomely realistic game entitled ‘murder’, which relies on someone drawing the Knave of Spades after cards are dealt. Tragedy strikes and other relationships are tested and consummated - but is this all real, or imagined? When a pregnant girl was found dead in a lonely moorland home. The gouse party reached its own verdict. Oblivious to her family's secret past, Olive Heriot escapes her country mansion to experience bohemian life in London. But when she meets charming Garry Links, heir to a vast fortune, everything changes...	{"authors": ["/authors/OL4325736A"], "subjects": ["1930s", "Contemporary", "Romance", "Suspense", "Fiction, romance, general", "Fiction, general"], "covers": [8260517]}

Angry and deeply miserable, Count Diakonov sets out on a railway journey to visit a relative in Northern France.  On the way, he encounters the revolutionary son of an old friend.  This man is seeking the Count because he, too, has been the victim of related Russian intrique.  What follows solves the mystery of Diakonov's exile, and changes his attitude to Russia.  Through the story, Rebecca West also tells the story of the passing of old Russia and the birth of the USSR.	{"authors": ["/authors/OL4363797A"], "subjects": ["Bolshevism (fiction)", "Fiction in English", "Russian revolution (fiction)"], "covers": [11390925]}

A braid of her hair had fallen forward as if she had been stooping over book or pen; and she stood for a moment to smooth it, and to gaze contemplatively - not in the least sentimentally - through the tall, narrow window. The sun was setting, but its glories were at the other side of the house; for this window looked eastward, where the landscape of sheepwalks and pasture land was sobering at the approach of darkness.  The lady, like one to whom silence and quiet were luxuries, lingered on the landing for some time. Then she turned towards another door, on which was inscribed, in white letters, Class Room No. 6. Arrested by a whispering above, she paused in the doorway, and looked up the stairs along a broad smooth handrail that swept round in an unbroken curve at each landing, forming an inclined plane from the top to the bottom of the house.	{"authors": ["/authors/OL2742646A"], "subjects": ["Translations into German", "Translations into Portuguese", "British and irish fiction (fictional works by one author)", "Fiction, humorous", "Fiction, humorous, general", "Large type books", "English fiction"], "first_publish_date": "1900", "covers": [6046060, 6353145, 6330273, -1, 10819210, 10959506, 11090999, 11272074, 12196930]}

/works/OL1109049W	The poet at the breakfast-table	In this, the third series of Breakfast-Table conversations, a slight dramatic background shows off a few talkers and writers, aided by certain silent supernumeraries. The machinery is much like that of the two preceding series. Some of the characters must seem like old acquaintances to those who have read the former papers. As I read these over for the first time for a number of years, I notice one character; presenting a class of beings who have greatly multiplied during the interval which separates the earlier and later Breakfast-Table papers,--I mean the scientific specialists. The entomologist, who confines himself rigidly to the study of the coleoptera, is intended to typify this class. The subdivision of labor, which, as we used to be told, required fourteen different workmen to make a single pin, has reached all branches of knowledge. We find new terms in all the Professions, implying that special provinces have been marked off, each having its own school of students. In theology we have many curious subdivisions; among the rest eschatology, that is to say, the geography, geology, etc., of the "undiscovered country;" in medicine, if the surgeon who deals with dislocations of the right shoulder declines to meddle with a displacement on the other side, we are not surprised, but ring the bell of the practitioner who devotes himself to injuries of the left shoulder.	{"authors": ["/authors/OL114139A"], "subjects": ["Medicine in literature", "Poetry", "Medicine in Literature"], "covers": [8245327]}
/works/OL110969W	El Aleph	In Borges' story, the Aleph is a point in space that contains all other points. Anyone who gazes into it can see everything in the universe from every angle simultaneously, without distortion, overlapping, or confusion. The story traces the theme of infinity found in several of Borges' other works, such as "The Book of Sand". As in many of Borges' short stories, the protagonist is a fictionalized version of the author. At the beginning of the story, he is mourning the recent death of a woman whom he loved, named Beatriz Viterbo, and resolves to stop by the house of her family to pay his respects. Over time, he comes to know her first cousin, Carlos Argentino Daneri, a mediocre poet with a vastly exaggerated view of his own talent who has made it his lifelong quest to write an epic poem that describes every single location on the planet in excruciatingly fine detail. Later in the story, a business on the same street attempts to tear down Daneri's house in the course of its expansion. Daneri becomes enraged, explaining to the narrator that he must keep the house in order to finish his poem, because the cellar contains an Aleph which he is using to write the poem. Though by now he believes Daneri to be quite insane, the narrator proposes without waiting for an answer to come to the house and see the Aleph for himself. Left alone in the darkness of the cellar, the narrator begins to fear that Daneri is conspiring to kill him, and then he sees the Aleph for himself: "On the back part of the step, toward the right, I saw a small iridescent sphere of almost unbearable brilliance. At first I thought it was revolving; then I realised that this movement was an illusion created by the dizzying world it bounded. The Aleph's diameter was probably little more than an inch, but all space was there, actual and undiminished. Each thing (a mirror's face, let us say) was infinite things, since I distinctly saw it from every angle of the universe. I saw the teeming sea; I saw daybreak and nightfall; I saw the multitudes of America; I saw a silvery cobweb in the center of a black pyramid; I saw a splintered labyrinth (it was London); I saw, close up, unending eyes watching themselves in me as in a mirror; I saw all the mirrors on earth and none of them reflected me; I saw in a backyard of Soler Street the same tiles that thirty years before I'd seen in the entrance of a house in Fray Bentos; I saw bunches of grapes, snow, tobacco, lodes of metal, steam; I saw convex equatorial deserts and each one of their grains of sand..." Though staggered by the experience of seeing the Aleph, the narrator pretends to have seen nothing in order to get revenge on Daneri, whom he dislikes, by giving Daneri a reason to doubt his own sanity. The narrator tells Daneri that he has lived too long amongst the noise and bustle of the city and spent too much time in the dark and enclosed space of his cellar, and assures him that what he truly needs are the wide open spaces and fresh air of the countryside, and these will provide him the true peace of mind that he needs to complete his poem. He then takes his leave of Daneri and exits the house. In a postscript to the story, Borges explains that Daneri's house was ultimately demolished, but that Daneri himself won second place for the Argentine National Prize for Literature. He also states his belief that the Aleph in Daneri's house was not the only one that exists, based on a report he has discovered, written by "Captain Burton" (Richard Francis Burton) when he was British consul in Brazil, describing the Mosque of Amr in Cairo, within which there is said to be a stone pillar that contains the entire universe; although this Aleph cannot be seen, it is said that those who put their ear to the pillar can hear a continuous hum that symbolises all the concurrent noises of the universe heard at any given time. - Wikipedia.	{"authors": ["/authors/OL18928A"], "subjects": ["Cuentos", "Short stories", "Translations into Italian", "Social life and customs", "Fiction", "Continental european fiction (fictional works by one author)", "Study guides", "Examinations", "Argentine Short stories", "Aleph (Borges, Jorge Luis)", "Romance literature"], "covers": [14408958]}

/works/OL1130412W	The blazed trail	|An honest young lumberman struggles against the subterfuges and attacks of an aggressive and duplicitous logging company. Set in the Saginaw area and the Upper Peninsula in the 1880s.*

Stewart Edward White (1873-1946) grew up in Grand Rapids, MI and was a graduate of the University of Michigan. An avid camper and outdoorsman, Theodore Roosevelt said he was “the best man with both pistol and rifle who ever shot” at Roosevelt’s rifle range at Sagamore Hill. White wrote fiction and non-fiction about adventure and travel, with an emphasis on natural history and outdoor living. Beginning in 1922, he and his wife Elizabeth wrote a number of books about spiritualism.

“White’s books were popular at a time when America was losing its vanishing wilderness. He was a keen observer of the beauties of nature and human nature, yet could render them in a plain-spoken style. Based on his own experience, whether writing camping journals or Westerns, he included pithy and fun details about cabin-building, canoeing, logging, gold-hunting, and guns and fishing and hunting. He also interviewed people who had been involved in the fur trade, the California gold rush and other pioneers which provided him with details that give his novels verisimilitude. He salted in humor and sympathy for colorful characters such as canny Indian guides and “greenhorn” campers who carried too much gear.”

No wonder Caro was ecstatic, then, to happen upon wealthy architect Francis Albany and his attractive cousin Will. Fate, she decided, could be very kind, indeed, although it sometimes needed a hefty push.

Too late she learned that the two men were not in the area entirely by chance. Unfortunately, by that time Caro was already in love--and so was Marian.|	{"authors": ["/authors/OL4759584A"], "covers": [11338983]}

The broad objective of this report was to extensively review literature on the effects of grazing on 25 plant communities of the southwestern U.S. in terms of plant species composition, aboveground primary productivity, and root and soil attributes. Livestock grazing management and grazing systems are assessed, as are effects of small and large native mammals and feral species, when data are available. Emphasis is placed on the evolutionary history of grazing and productivity of the particular communities as determinants of response. After reviewing available studies for each community type, we compare changes in species composition with grazing among community types. Comparisons are also made between southwestern communities with a relatively short history of grazing and communities of the adjacent Great Plains with a long evolutionary history of grazing. Evidence for grazing as a factor in shifts from grasslands to shrublands is considered. An appendix outlines a new community classification system, which is followed in describing grazing impacts in prior sections.	{"authors": ["/authors/OL5438073A"], "subjects": ["Range plants", "Effect of grazing on", "Ecology", "Management", "Grazing"], "first_publish_date": "2006"}
/works/OL12388629W	The anatomist	"Hayes's history of the illustrated medical text "Gray's Anatomy" coincides with the hundred-and-fiftieth anniversary of its first publication. Fascinated by the fact that little was known about the famous book's genesis, Hayes combed through nineteenth-century letters and medical-school records, learning that, besides Henry Gray, the brilliant scholar and surgeon who wrote the text, another anatomist was crucial to the book's popularity: Henry Vandyke Carter, who provided its painstaking drawings. Hayes moves nimbly between the dour streets of Victorian London, where Gray and Carter trained at St. George's Hospital, and the sunnier classrooms of a West Coast university filled with athletic physical therapists in training, where he enrolls in anatomy classes and discovers that "when done well, dissection is very pleasing aesthetically."   - The New Yorker"All laud and honor to Hayes....In perusing the body's 650 muscles and 206 bones, he has made the case that we are, as the psalmist wrote, "fearfully and wonderfully made" and that dissection has an aesthetic all its own. The act of carving open a body becomes, in this context, a perverse act of love, a desecration that consecrates "the extraordinary, the inner architecture of the human form." - The Washington Post"How do you write a book about someone about whom next to nothing is known? For most writers, the answer would be move on to the next subject. But Bill Hayes has an unusual set of skills. The author of previous books on insomnia and blood, he is part science writer, part memoirist, part culture explainer. "The Anatomist," his appealing new book about the man behind Gray's Anatomy, combines his search for the remaining traces of Henry Gray with a memoir of his own experience as a dissection student and a scalpel's-eye tour of the body." - The New York Times"Some of [Hayes's] most memorable writing describes the dissection classes he attended in San Francisco. We are treated to a selection of fascinating anatomical snippets about, for example, how to trace evidence of the sealed hole in the fetal heart through which the mother's blood enters; or how to find the kidney in a cadaver; or that blood flowing out of the heart is first used to feed the heart itself; or, best of all, a structural analysis of how the Queen manages to deliver such a uniquely restrained wave." - Nature: The International Weekly Journal of ScienceThe classic medical text known as Gray's Anatomy is one of the most famous books ever written. Now, on the 150th anniversary of its publication, acclaimed science writer and master of narrative nonfiction Bill Hayes has written the fascinating, never-before-told true story of how this seminal volume came to be. A blend of history, science, culture, and Hayes's own personal experiences, The Anatomist is this author's most accomplished and affecting work to date.With passion and wit, Hayes explores the significance of Gray's Anatomy and explains why it came to symbolize a turning point in medical history. But he does much, much more. Uncovering a treasure trove of forgotten letters and diaries, he illuminates the astonishing relationship between the fiercely gifted young anatomist Henry Gray and his younger collaborator H. V. Carter, whose exquisite anatomical illustrations are masterpieces of art and close observation. Tracing the triumphs and tragedies of these two extraordinary men, Hayes brings an equally extraordinary era--the mid-1800s--unforgettably to life.But the journey Hayes takes us on is not only outward but inward--through the blood and tissue and organs of the human...	{"authors": ["/authors/OL5450640A"], "subtitle": "a true story of Gray's anatomy", "subjects": ["Anatomists", "Anatomy", "Biography", "History", "History, 19th Century", "Nonfiction", "Personal narratives", "Students", "Gray, Henry, -- 1825-1861"], "first_publish_date": "2008", "dewey_number": ["611.0092/2"], "covers": [8229184]}

/works/OL13636133W	Moon boots and dinner suits	Jon Pertwee's acting career began with a public performance at the age of four. He seems to have been expelled from most of the schools his actor-writer father Roland Pertwee sent him to and finally joined RADA in 1936. From there too, he was asked to leave. Jon went into Rep and had a checkered career. In Brighton panic set in when he dressed as an old gardener in "Love from a Stranger" instead of as a young cleric in "Candida". In 1938 came Jon's first radio role in the BBC's "Lillibulero", in which year he also appeared in his father's play, "To Kill a Cat", directed by Henry Kendall at the Aldwych Theatre. When war came he joined the Navy, ramming Douglas Pier with an Isle of Man Steam Packet boat. He was blown up twice, once being put on a marble slab presumed dead, and spent many months stationed in the Scapa Flow. He was the founder of the Service Players in the Isle of Man. He was commissioned in the RNVR and transferred to Naval Intelligence where he worked and became good friends with the future Prime Minister James Callaghan. Then Jon joined Naval Broadcasting. His radio series, "The Navy Lark", ran for eighteen years and produced some truly vintage memories of radio. Whether telling stories of misspent youth, of his posterior's first painful introduction to a fives bat or his exploits with the McKenzie sisters in the north of Scotland, Jon Pertwee's humour and natural wit never fail him. "Moon Boots and Dinner Suits" is a wry, funny and endearing portrait of the early years of a most innovative and well loved actor. ~from inside jacket flap	{"authors": ["/authors/OL6492586A"], "subjects": ["Actors", "Biography"], "first_publish_date": "1984", "dewey_number": ["792/.028/0924"]}
/works/OL13644266W	What drives the current account in commodity exporting countries?	This paper uses an open economy DSGE model with a commodity sector and nominal and real rigidities to ask what factors account for current account developments in two small commodity exporting countries. We estimate the model, using Bayesian techniques, on Chilean and on New Zealand data, and investigate the structural factors that explain the behaviour of the two countries' current accounts. We find that foreign financial conditions, investment-specific shocks, and foreign demand account for the bulk of the variation of the current accounts of the two countries. In the case of New Zealand fluctuations in commodity export prices have also been important. Monetary and fiscal policy shocks (deviations from policy rules) are estimated to have relatively small e ects on the current account.We find interesting differences in Chilean and New Zealand responses to some shocks, despite similarities between the two economies and the common structural model employed.	{"authors": ["/authors/OL6500456A"], "first_publish_date": "2008"}

/works/OL13668649W	Economics for humans	At its core, an economy is about providing goods and services for human well-being. But many economists and critics preach that an economy is something far different: a cold and heartless system that operates outside of human control. In this impassioned and perceptive work, Julie A. Nelson asks a compelling question: If our economic world is something that we as humans create, aren't ethics and human relationships—dimensions of a full and rich life—intrinsically part of the picture? Is it possible to take this thing we call economics and give it a body and a soul?Economics for Humans argues against the well-ingrained notion that economics is immune to moral values and distant from human relationships. Here, Nelson locates the impediment to envisioning a more considerate economic world in an assumption that is shared by both neoliberals and the political left. Despite their seemingly insurmountable differences, Nelson notes that they both make use of the metaphor, first proposed by Adam Smith, that the economy is a machine. This pervasive idea, Nelson argues, has blinded us to the qualities that make us work and care for one another—qualities that also make businesses thrive and markets grow. We can wed our interest in money with our justifiable concerns about ethics and social well-being. And we can do so if we recognize that an economy is not a machine, but a living, beating heart that circulates blood to all parts of the body while also serving as an emblem of compassion and care.Nothing less than a manifesto, Economics for Humans will both invigorate and inspire readers to reshape the way they view the economy, its possibilities, and their place within it.	{"authors": ["/authors/OL6524153A"], "subjects": ["Business", "Nonfiction", "Economics, moral and ethical aspects", "Feminist economics"], "first_publish_date": "2006", "covers": [6393426]}

He teaches her to preserve memories like dispersed and broken pieces of antique pottery. After his death, Eleni keeps coming back to these sights of her childhood as a grown-up woman to be true to his legacy. For everything tells of the ancestors' labour and sweat but also of the miseries of the refugees from both countries: Here is Lesbos, there is Asia-Minor, the former Greek home, and in between, the silver, starry strip of the Aegean Sea. Surely, the other half of the collected pottery must lie on the opposite, Turkish coast."

He is a hard-core birdwatcher (aka twitcher').Sean takes a year off to try to break the Australian twitching record - he has to see more than 700 birds in twelve months. Travelling the length and breadth of Australia, he stops at nothing in search of this birdwatching Holy Grail, blowing his inheritance, his career prospects and any chance he has of finding a girlfriend.Part confessional, part travelogue, this is a true story about obsession. It's about seeking the meaning of life, trying to work out what normal' is, and searching for the elusive Grey Falcon (the bird, not the car).

/works/OL1397491W	The genius of Alexander the Great	By the time of his death in 323 BC, Alexander III of Macedonia had built an empire that stretched from the eastern Mediterranean coast through Asia minor and into the Indus Valley. A former student of the philosopher Aristotle, Alexander succeeded Philip the second as king of Macedonia in 336 BC and spent the next 13 years subduing and consolidating the lands of the Persian Empire. Even before his sudden death at the age of 32, Alexander had achieved mythical status throughout his kingdom, and in the centuries that followed, his life became the subject of countless chronicles and biographies. N.G.L. Hammond, the foremost expert on ancient Macedonian history, here presents a new account of Alexander's fabled career. Through a careful analysis of ancient sources -- the writings of Diodorus, Justin, Curtius, Plutarch, and Arrian -- Hammond has effectively separated the work of reliable contemporaries from fictional reports of Alexander's accomplishments. The resulting narrative, enriched by a lifetime of research, pronounces the Macedonian conqueror a man truly deserving of the title Alexander the Great. - Jacket flap.	{"authors": ["/authors/OL143719A"], "subjects": ["Kings and rulers", "Generals", "Psychology", "Influence", "Influence (Literary, artistic, etc.)", "Macedonian Expansion (Greece : 359-323 B.C.) fast (OCoLC)fst01353599", "Biography", "History", "Alexander, the great, 356 b.c.-323 b.c."], "first_publish_date": "1997", "covers": [590860]}

/works/OL1410429W	Ainsi parla l'oncle	|Ainsi parla l’Oncle, paru pour la première fois en 1928, est le premier manifeste de la condition noire. Cet ouvrage a influencé l’œuvre et la pensée des auteurs du mouvement de la négritude comme Léopold Sédar Senghor, Aimé Césaire et Léon-Gontran Damas.
Son ouvrage majeur Ainsi parla l'oncle (1928), écrit en français, étudie les fondements à la fois historiques et folkloriques de la culture haïtienne. Price-Mars y affirme que les Haïtiens ne sont pas des «Français colorés», mais des hommes nés en des conditions historiques déterminées et ayant un double héritage, français et africain. Ainsi parla l'oncle est la première tentative de réaliser une étude systématique de la culture des masses haïtiennes en la plaçant dans le cadre de la communauté nationale. Écrit pendant l'occupation américaine d'Haïti (1915-1934), ce livre pionnier vise clairement le but de soutenir le moral des Haïtiens en développant un nationalisme culturel.
Réédité dans un nouveau format, avec une iconographie nouvelle (paysages et figures de l’Afrique et d’Haïti), cet ouvrage propose une relecture de cette œuvre monumentale qui a servi de bréviaire aux intellectuels des peuples noirs. Pour penser le monde, pour comprendre les mécanismes de l’aliénation, soit du « bovarysme culturel », Jean Price-Mars a mis en avant les traditions, les légendes populaires, le vaudou et tout l’héritage africain qui fondent les cultures noires.
Ainsi parla l'Oncle, premier manifeste de la négritude, paru en 1928, est le grand livre sur la condition noire, sur la relation à l'Afrique et à sa culture. Lire aujourd'hui Ainsi parla l'Oncle pour découvrir un geste essentiel.
Au bout de ma quête, je devais trouver Alain Locke et Jean Price-Mars. Et je lus Ainsi parla l'Onde d'un trait comme l'eau de la citerne, au soir, après une longue étape dans le désert, j'étais comblé. Léopold Sédar SENGHOR
Ainsi parla l'Oncle illumine de manière magistrale les efforts que nos pères ont dû accomplir pour entrer - et nous après eux ? dans le cercle interdit de l'humanité. Maryse CONDÉ
JEAN PRICE-MARS : Nous avons longtemps nourri l'ambition de relever aux yeux du peuple haïtien la valeur de son folk-lore. Toute la matière de ce livre n'est qu'une tentative d'intégrer la pensée populaire haïtienne dans la discipline de l'ethnographie traditionnelle.
[…]
Mais, nous dira-t-on, à quoi bon se donner tant de peine à propos de menus problèmes qui n'intéressent qu'une très infime minorité d'hommes, habitant une très infime partie de la surface terrestre ?
On a peut-être raison.
Nous nous permettrons d'objecter cependant que ni l'exiguité de notre territoire, ni la faiblesse numérique de notre peuple ne sont motifs suffisants pour que les problèmes qui mettent en cause le comportement d'un groupe d'hommes soient indifférents au reste de l'humanité. En outre, notre présence sur un point de cet archipel américain que nous avons « humanisé », la trouée que nous avons faite dans le processus des évènements historiques pour agripper notre place parmi les hommes, notre façon d'utiliser les lois de l'imitation pour essayer de nous faire une âme d'emprunt, la déviation pathologique que nous avons infligée au bovarysme des collectivités en nous concevant autres que nous ne sommes, l'incertitude tragique qu'une telle démarche imprime à notre évolution au moment où les impérialismes de tous ordres camouflent leurs convoitises sous des dehors de philantropie, tout cela donne un certain relief à l'existence de la communauté haïtienne et, devant que la nuit vienne, il n'est pas inutile de recueillir les faits de notre vie sociale, de fixer les gestes, les attitudes de notre peuple, de scruter leurs origines et de les situer dans la vie générale de l'homme sur la planète. Ils sont des témoins dont la déposition ne peut être négligeable pour juger la valeur d'une partie de l'espèce humaine.
Tel est, en dernière analyse, le sens de notre entreprise, et quelque soit l'accueil qu'on lui réserve, nous voulons qu'on sache que nous ne sommes pas dupes de son insuffisance et de sa précarité. — Pétionville, le 15 décembre 1927|	{"authors": ["/authors/OL145579A"], "subjects": ["Social life and customs", "Ethnology", "Voodooism", "Folklore", "Vodou", "Continental european drama (dramatic works by one author)", "Social life andcustoms"], "first_publish_date": "1983", "dewey_number": ["398/.097294"], "covers": [14324455]}

/works/OL14847922W	The best revenge	In a riveting new novel of psychological suspense, Stephen White shines a brilliant light on the darkness that hides just beneath the surface of ordinary lives, on the fears that cripple us and the prisons we create --prisons of the body, mind, and spirit.  A thriller of runaway tension, taps into our most closely guarded fears, taking us on a harrowing journey into a realm of terror and pain, of love gone wrong and vengeance gone mad.The Best RevengePsychologist Alan Gregory is living through a season of discontent. With a new daughter, a wonderful wife, and a prospering career, he has little to complain about and lots of regrets: past cases that won't let him go, patients who don't get better, and a growing unease with keeping secrets. But Gregory has two new patients who will drag him out of his introspection--and dare him to enter a storm of injustice and revenge. FBI special agent Kelda James is a hero, a woman who as a rookie agent made a choice, drew her gun, and saved a life, taking another. Now Kelda is hiding from the world a secret pain that is gradually crippling her body--and she has turned to Alan Gregory to help free her from the prison of her pain. Then Kelda refers a patient to Gregory, who is terrifyingly dangerous to them both.Tom Clone served thirteen years on Colorado's death row for a crime he claimed he didn't commit--until an FBI agent dug up evidence that set him free. The agent's name: Kelda James. With both Kelda and Clone telling him their innermost secrets, Alan Gregory becomes the one person who can piece together an extraordinary puzzle--of two unsolved violent deaths of vulnerable women, of a man who may be innocent or may be very lucky, and of the strange, fatal attraction between two people trapped in a horrific plot to get revenge--at any price.A thriller that delivers a stunning body-blow of a surprise ending, captures lives colliding at unpredictable angles, probing the dangerous lies people tell to each other and themselves. In this astonishing work by a novelist at the height of his powers, Stephen White brilliantly blends thrilling action and breakneck pacing with unrivaled insight into the human mind, heart, and psyche.

The Master at his scarifying best! From heart-pounding terror to the eeriest of whimsy--tales from the outer limits of one of the greatest imaginations of our time!

Evil that breathes and walks and shrieks, brave new worlds and horror shows, human desperation bursting into deadly menace--such are the themes of these astounding works of fiction. In the tradition of Poe and Stevenson, of Lovecraft and The Twilight Zone, Stephen King has fused images of fear as old as time with the iconography of contemporary American life to create his own special brand of horror--one that has kept millions of readers turning the pages even as they gasp.

In the book-length story "The Mist," a supermarket becomes the last bastion of humanity as a peril beyond dimension invades the earth. . .

Touch "The Man Who Would Not Shake Hands," and say your prayers . . .

There are some things in attics which are better left alone, things like "The Monkey" . . .

The most sublime woman driver on earth offers a man "Mrs. Todd's Shortcut" to paradise . . .

A boy's sanity is pushed to the edge when he's left alone with the odious corpse of "Gramma" . . .

If you were stunned by Gremlins, the Fornits of "The Ballad of the Flexible Bullet" will knock your socks off . . .

Trucks that punish and beautiful teen demons who seduce a young man to massacre; curses whose malevolence grows through the years; obscene presences and angels of grace--here, indeed, is a night-blooming bouquet of chills and thrills.

/works/OL14933275W	The Virgin Goddess	|"The Virgin Goddess" is a meticulously researched story of a girl who was selected as the Royal Kumari of Kathmandu, Nepal at the age of four. A Kumari is a pre-pubescent girl who is worshipped as a living goddess until she begins to menstruate - unless she suffers an accident involving the loss of a large amount of blood, in which case she is replaced at that time. All being well, she is only deposed at puberty, when she rejoins her family - and society - as an ordinary girl, while another pre-pubescent girl takes her place as the living goddess. The prevailing trend is to de-mystify such ancient traditions - but this novel, which is the only one ever to have been written about this subject, exuberantly re-mystifies it, revealing a clear-eyed understanding of the deep spiritual knowledge which nourishes this cultural practice.

The heroine of "The Virgin Goddess" is called Archita Shakya. The novel tells the story of her life as the Kumari and her attempts to adjust to life afterwards. When she is deposed she returns to her family and acquires an education which is cut short during the pro-democracy struggles in Nepal of 1989-1990. Her marriage is arranged to a man who is murdered on their wedding night. She escapes from Kathmandu with the help of her childhood friend who facilitates her flight by arranging a new identity for her. On her escape journey she is robbed and left for dead. However, she survives (though she suffers temporary amnesia) and marries an English artist who does not know that she was the Kumari. He takes her to London with him. In England she attempts to make her mark as an artist, but is committed to a psychiatric hospital after her second husband dies. By the time she comes out she has lost her original identity completely. 

While telling Archita Shakya’s story the novel explores the impact of cultural background and conditioning, religion, power, and status on personal identity.|	{"authors": ["/authors/OL3091756A"], "covers": [2112482]}

It's possible the comet will just graze the Earth's atmosphere. But you know there's a good chance the comet will either strike the city of Los Angeles or crash into the Pacific Ocean, causing an enormous tidal wave to sweep throughout the country. The President orders NASA to fire a missile to change the comet's collision course. People are fleeing from the area. Your parents can't decide what to do and turn to you for advice. What do you suggest?
If you advise your family to head for Canada, turn to page 34. If you decide to wait and see if NASA is able to divert the comet, turn to page 36. Probably the safest decision is to escape. On the other hand, you run the risk of having your home looted while you're gone. And it seems likely that NASA will succeed in diverting the comet. But think carefully. A comet is certainly a power beyond your control.

In a groundbreaking study of these two disparate groups - affectionately labeled "geeks" and "geezers" - leadership experts Warren G. Bennis and Robert J. Thomas set out to find how era and values shape those who lead. What they discovered was something even more profound: the powerful process through which leaders of any era emerge.".

"Geeks and Geezers will forever change how we view leadership, but also how we reflect on our own formative experiences. Illustrated by compelling interviews with extraordinary individuals under thirty-five and over seventy years of age, the authors present a new model that predicts who is likely to become and remain a leader - and explains why others fail to rise to the challenge.

At its heart are what the authors call "crucibles" - utterly transformational experiences from which one can emerge either hopelessly broken or powerfully emboldened to learn and to lead."--BOOK JACKET.|	{"authors": ["/authors/OL225457A"], "subjects": ["Leadership", "Executive ability", "Biography", "Executives", "Leaders", "Chefs d'entreprise", "Biographies", "Famous Persons", "Aptitude pour la direction", "Achievement", "Social Environment"], "covers": [834777]}

Local governments may respond to local conditions, but ignore inter-jurisdictional spillovers.  Alternatively, central governments may internalize spillovers, but impose uniform regulations ignoring local hetero-geneity.  We provide a simple model that demonstrates that the choice of policy depends crucial-ly on the shape of marginal abatement costs.  If marginal costs are increasing and convex, then abatement cost elasticities will tend to be higher around the local policies.  This increases the deadweight loss of those policies relative to the centralized policy, ceteris paribus. Using a large simulation model, we then empirically explore the tradeoffs between local versus second-best uniform policies for US air pollution.  We find that US states acting in their own interest lose about 31.5 % of the potential first-best benefits, whereas the second-best uniform policy loses only 0.2 % of benefits.  The centralized policy outperforms the state policy for two reasons.  First, inter-state spillovers are simply more important that inter-state hetero-geneity in this application.  Second, welfare losses are especially small under the uniform policy because elasticities are much higher over the relevant range of the cost functions"--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.	{"authors": ["/authors/OL6787602A"], "subtitle": "environmental federalism and US air pollution"}

An archaeological dig is preparing to open the Hall of Records, a repository of ancient knowledge hidden beneath the enigmatic statue. But on the night of the unveiling student Macy Sharif makes a shocking discovery: a religious cult already raiding the Hall of Records to find the location of the mythical Pyramid of Osiris. Framed by corrupt officials, she goes on the run, trying to reach the only people who can save her before she is silenced permanently. Discredited, jobless and broke, archaeologist Nina Wilde and ex-SAS soldier Eddie Chase have problems of their own until Macy's plea for help sends them on a deadly quest across the globe as they try to reach the mysterious pyramid before Khalid Osir, the charismatic leader of the Osirian Temple. But is the cult's motive purely greed... or something more sinister?	{"authors": ["/authors/OL6808264A"], "subjects": ["Eddie Chase (Fictitious character)", "Excavations (Archaeology)", "Women archaeologists", "Nina Wilde (Fictitious character)", "Fiction", "Women archaeologists, fiction", "Egypt, fiction", "Fiction, suspense", "Fiction, thrillers, general", "Soldiers of fortune", "Italo-Ethiopian War, 1935-1936", "Illegal arms transfers", "Fiction, thrillers, suspense"], "covers": [6387966]}
/works/OL15167180W	19th Century Orleans Par LA Marriage Index v10 1807-1900	|Hunting For Bears Genealogy Society collects and maintains large databases of early (predominantly pre 1900) marriage records from all fifty states. We are currently processing these records and will have them on line as soon as they are ready.

We do two things with these records:
One, we publish these records in County Marriage Record Books, (over 2,000 to date) and on CDs. We no longer publish on microfiche but have a fairly complete inventory of our collection up to 1980.

Two, surname searches of these large computer databases have been available to individuals since the late 1960s via the U. S. Postal Service and now e-mail. We search our marriage indexes on a state by state basis and provide the results via e-mail or computer printout.

The Hunting For Bears marriage data collection as of about 1980, was the world's largest collection of U.S. marriage records in private hands. Eighteen states of data were availble for surname searches and were offered for sale on CDs in conjunction with Automated Archives(c).

Family Tree Maker(c) personal genealogy software bundled the H.F.B. marriage data with their product and sold tens of thousands of the various packages. The H.F.B. marriage data was crucial in making FTM(c) the most popular genealogical software in the world.

The same collection was included in Ancestry.com's(c) initial data searches, playing a significant role in its rise to the world's premier genealogy data search engine.

That was the 1980 collection, the 2010 collection dwarfs it in comparison. This book is part of that 2010 collection. It is maintained in a data base structure to provide the highest information density. Each marriage is contained in one line. Each party in the union is included in the alphabetical listing. Using the records in a database format and listing both participants in the alphabetical sort was so unique in 1960 that the U.S. Government has granted Hunting For Bears a (c)copyright on the collection in both print and later electronic and microform format.

Several things we are considering in the immediate future are; e_books to buy, loan or free downloads, books available through instant publication, and books on line.

Oh, the name and logo, Russell, as Nick was called in his youth, loved puns. The newspaper genealogy column that he began writing in 1951, Hunting Your Forebears, quickly became Hunting For Bears and the bear and hunter logo was created.

When available, record location information such as county book and page number may be included as well as age, birth or death dates, race, gender and information about prior marriages.|	{"authors": ["/authors/OL987399A", "/authors/OL7169059A"], "subjects": ["hfblano19", "hfb", "hfbla", "19th Century Orleans Parish Marriages 1807-1900", "vital", "vital record", "genealogy", "louisiana marriage record", "marriages", "louisiana ancestry", "louisiana archive", "louisiana vital records", "louisiana genealogies", "louisiana marriages", "cajun heritage", "la licences", "marriage licence", "marriage permit", "marr certificate", "joining", "union", "partner", "bride", "groom", "kin. kindred", "french", "spanish"], "covers": [6760364, 6760363]}

But when the two federal agents assigned to the investigation are taken out, the FBI takes a more personal interest in the case.Special Agent Ty Grady is cocky, abrasive, and indisputably the best at what he does. But when he's paired with Special Agent Zane Garrett, it's hate at first sight. Garrett is the perfect image of an agent: serious, sober, and focused, which makes their partnership a classic cliche: total opposites, good cop-bad cop, the odd couple. They both know immediately that their partnership will pose more of an obstacle than the lack of evidence left by the murderer.Practically before their special assignment starts, the murderer strikes again – this time at them. Now on the run, Grady and Garrett have to figure out how to work together before they become two more notches in the murderer's knife.	{"authors": ["/authors/OL3765529A"], "subjects": ["Erotic Literature", "Fiction", "Romance", "Suspense", "Fiction, lgbtq+, gay", "Fiction, mystery & detective, general"], "covers": [11012141]}

/works/OL15172650W	The Big Moo	33 of the world's best business minds tackle one urgent question: What does it really take to make your organization remarkable?Most organizations are stuck in a rut. On one hand, they understand all the good things that will come with growth. On the other, they're petrified that growth means change, and change means risk, and risk means death. Nobody wants to screw up and ruin a good thing, so most companies (and individuals) just keep trying to be perfect at the things they've always done.In 2003, Seth Godin's Purple Cow challenged organizations to become remarkable—to drive growth by standing out in a world full of brown cows. It struck a huge chord and stayed on the Business-Week bestseller list for nearly two years. You can hear countless brainstorming meetings where people refer to purple cows and say things like, "That's not good enough. We need to create a big moo!"But how do you create a big moo—an insight so astounding that people can't help but remark on it, like digital TV recording (TiVo) or overnight shipping (FedEx), or the world's best vacuum cleaner (Dyson)? Godin worked with thirty-two of the world's smartest thinkers to answer this critical question. And the team—with the likes of Tom Peters, Malcolm Gladwell, Guy Kawasaki, Mark Cuban, Robyn Waters, Dave Balter, Red Maxwell, and Randall Rothenberg on board— created an incredibly useful book that's fun to read and perfect for groups to share, discuss, and apply.The Big Moo is a simple book in the tradition of Fish and Don't Sweat the Small Stuff. Instead of lecturing you, it tells stories that stick to your ribs and light your fire. It will help you to create a culture that consistently delivers remarkable innovations.	{"authors": ["/authors/OL6813362A"], "subjects": ["Business", "Nonfiction", "Success in business"], "covers": [6430224]}

Tillyer’s ‘countries’ are an assortment of light and dark witty tales, mixed with a healthy amount of satire and relevance to the contemporary world. Tillyer provides enjoyable escapes from otherwise monotonous journeys, transporting the reader to worlds where a city of idealists try to build the perfect ship, or a golf course where only robots can play, discovering an archipelago where an entire race are burying themselves alive or, aptly, a rail network where passengers can get lost forever. Generally speaking, novels tend to focus on the individual characters as protagonists, whereas A.C. Tillyer turns that around and makes the crowd the central character of her stories to see what happens when people follow the herd.	{"authors": ["/authors/OL6813325A"], "subjects": ["Fantasy", "Fiction", "Literature", "Short Stories"]}

/works/OL15178780W	Home Boy	"Naqvi's fast-paced plot, foul-mouthed erudition and pitch-perfect dialogue make for a stellar debut."--Publishers Weekly (Starred Review)They are renaissance men. They are bons vivants. They are three young Pakistani men in New York City at the turn of the millennium: AC, a gangsta-rap-spouting academic; Jimbo, a hulking Pushtun DJ from the streets of Jersey City; and Chuck, a wideeyed kid, fresh off the boat from the homeland, just trying to get by. Things start coming together for Chuck when he unexpectedly secures a Wall Street gig and begins rolling with socialites and scenesters flanked by his pals, who routinely bring down the house at hush-hush downtown haunts. In a city where origins matter less than the talent for self-invention, the three Metrostanis have the guts to claim the place as their own. But when they embark on a road trip to the hinterland weeks after 9/11 in search of the Shaman, a Gatsbyesque compatriot who seemingly disappears into thin air, things go horribly wrong. Suddenly, they find themselves in a changed, charged America.Rollicking, bittersweet, and sharply observed, Home Boy is at once an immigrant's tale, a mystery, and a story of love and loss, as well as a unique meditation on Americana and notions of collective identity. It announces the debut of an original, electrifying voice in contemporary fiction.From the Hardcover edition.	{"authors": ["/authors/OL6815759A"], "subjects": ["Fiction"]}

/works/OL15180160W	Sustainable Brownfield Regeneration	Sustainable Brownfield Regeneration presents a comprehensive account of UK policies, processes and practices in brownfield regeneration and takes an integrated and theoretically-grounded approach to highlight best practice.    Brownfield regeneration has become a major policy driver in developed countries. It is estimated that there are 64,000 hectares of brownfield land in England, much of which presents severe environmental challenges and lies alongside some of the most deprived communities in the country. Bringing such land back into active use has taken on a new urgency among policymakers, developers and other stakeholders in the development process. Frequently, however, policy thinking and practice has been underpinned by 'silo' mentalities, in which integrated and multidisciplinary approaches to problem-solving have been limited.    The book has two principal aims. The first is to examine the ways in which science and social science research disciplines can be brought together to help solve important brownfield regeneration issues, with a focus on the UK. The second is to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of different types of regeneration policy and practice, and to show how 'liveable spaces' can be produced from 'problem places'. The Thames Gateway in the south of England and Greater Manchester in the North of England are shown as examples of how brownfield regeneration projects are developing in an era where sustainability is high on the policy agenda.    From the Foreword by Paul Syms, National Brownfield Advisor, English Partnerships:    'Ensuring the effective and efficient reuse of brownfield land is an essential part of the British Government's land use policies in support of sustainable communities. [This book] recognises that reusing brownfield land is not just about over-coming technical issues to remove contamination or other physical problems with the ground. It highlights the importance of engaging with the many different stakeholders whose opinions and concerns need to be taken into account if sustainable outcomes are to be achieved. The authors also recognise that brownfield land reuse is not just about building new homes or places of employment - the creation of new green spaces can be just as important.'	{"authors": ["/authors/OL3152707A"], "subjects": ["Engineering", "Nonfiction", "Technology", "City planning", "Sustainable development", "Urban renewal", "Brownfields"], "covers": [6437074]}

/works/OL15187018W	Lift Every Voice and Sing	A Celebration of the Negro National Anthem; 100 Years, 100 Voices"A group of young men in Jacksonville, Florida, arranged to celebrate Lincoln's birthday in 1900. My brother, J. Rosamond Johnson, and I decided to write a song to be sung at the exercise. I wrote the words and he wrote the music. Our New York publisher, Edward B. Marks, made mimeographed copies for us and the song was taught to and sung by a chorus of five hundred colored school children."Shortly afterwards my brother and I moved from Jacksonville to New York, and the song passed out of our minds. But the school children of Jacksonville kept singing it, they went off to other schools and sang it, they became teachers and taught it to other children. Within twenty years it was being sung over the South and in some other parts of the country. Today, the song, popularly known as the Negro National Hymn, is quite generally used."The lines of this song repay me in elation, almost of exquisite anguish, whenever I hear them sung by Negro children."        --James Weldon Johnson, 1935Pasted into Bibles, schoolbooks, and hearts, "Lift Every Voice and Sing," written by J. Rosamond Johnson and James Weldon Johnson in 1900, has become one of the most beloved songs in the African American community--taught for years in schools, churches, and civic organizations. Adopted by the NAACP as its official song in the 1920s and sung throughout the civil rights movement, it is still heard today at gatherings across America.James Weldon Johnson's lyrics pay homage to a history of struggle but never waver from a sense of optimism for the future--"facing the rising sun of our new day begun, let us march on till victory is won." Its message of hope and strength has made "Lift Every Voice and Sing" a source of inspiration for generations.In celebration of the song's centennial, Julian Bond and Sondra Kathryn Wilson have collected one hundred essays by artists, educators, politicians, and activists reflecting on their personal experiences with the song. Also featuring photos from historical archives, Lift Every Voice and Sing is a moving illustration of the African American experience in the past century. With contributors including John Hope Franklin, Jesse Jackson, Maya Angelou, Norman Lear, Maxine Waters, and Percy Sutton, this volume is a personal tribute to the enduring power of an anthem. "Lift Every Voice and Sing" has touched the hearts of many who have heard it because its true aim, as Harry Belafonte explains, "isn't just to show life as it is but to show life as it should be."	{"authors": ["/authors/OL2033436A"], "subjects": ["Nonfiction", "Sociology"]}

So what if her house is a shambles? Who cares when she last changed her clothes? If an eighty-two-year-old widow wants to live on junk food, pills, and cigarettes, hasn't she earned the right? When her kids force her into The Palisades, an assisted living facility, Cora takes to her bed, planning to die as soon as possible. But life isn't finished with her yet, not by a long shot.Deciding that truth is the best revenge, Cora begins to write a tell-all journal that reveals once and for all the secret she has guarded since she was a young woman. In entries that are profane, profound, and gossipy, she chronicles her childhood in rural Missouri, her shotgun wedding, and the terrible event that changed the course of her life. Intermingled with her reminiscences is an account of the day-to-day dramas at The Palisades--her budding romance with a suave new resident, feuds with her tablemates, her rollicking camaraderie with the man who oversees her health care, and the sinister cloud of suspicion that descends as a series of petty crimes sets everyone on edge. The story builds to a powerful climax as Cora's revelations about her past mesh with the unraveling intrigue in the present.Cora is by turns outrageous, irreverent, and wickedly funny. Despite a life with more than its share of disappointment and struggle, she refuses to go gently into her twilight years, remaining intensely curious, disinclined to play it safe, and willing to start over. Breaking Out of Bedlam captures the loneliness and secrets that lurk within families, the hardscrabble reality facing women with limited resources, and the resilience of a woman who survives, despite all the odds, through an unlikely combination of passion, humor, and faith.From the Hardcover edition.	{"authors": ["/authors/OL6819314A"], "subjects": ["Fiction", "Literature"]}

There's even a picture of his house on the reverse of that same nickel. You've seen him chiseled in stone on a mountain and cast in bronze to heroic measure. He is monumental, semi-mythical. But what was Thomas Jefferson like, off his pedestal, alive, human? The man whom author Page Smith has found in this perceptive biography is someone you can envision at eye level, even get to know. He is real: tall, freckled, a bit rumpled, humorless, sensitive. Jefferson was an artist -- with words, with architecture, with ideas. Jefferson was not a politician, yet he became President. Jefferson inherited large estates and many slaves, but stayed in debt most of his life. His star-crossed relations with the women in his life, from his mother to "Dashing Sally," his lovely slave and reputed mistress, are often as awkward as any teenager's. Once you have met Thomas Jefferson the man, Thomas Jefferson the American hero and legend becomes all the more impressive.	{"authors": ["/authors/OL139383A"], "subjects": ["History", "Nonfiction"]}

It was a note from William Shakespeare. Or was it? In the months that followed, Ireland produced a torrent of Shakespearean fabrications: letters, poetry, drawings—even an original full-length play that would be hailed as the Bard's lost masterpiece and staged at the Drury Lane Theatre. The documents were forensically implausible, but the people who inspected them ached to see first hand what had flowed from Shakespeare's quill. And so they did. This dramatic and improbable story of Shakespeare's teenaged double takes us to eighteenth century London and brings us face-to-face with history's most audacious forger.	{"authors": ["/authors/OL970028A"], "subjects": ["History", "Nonfiction"], "covers": [6448065]}

/works/OL15191786W	Mechanics of Composite Structures	An increase in the use of composite materials in areas of engineering has led to a greater demand for engineers versed in the design of structures made from such materials. Few existing books demonstrate advanced concepts or emphasize structures. This book addresses that need by offering students and engineers tools for designing practical composite structures. Among the topics of interest to the designer are stress-strain relationships for a wide range of anisotropic materials; bending, buckling, and vibration of plates; bending, torsion, buckling, and vibration of solid as well as thin walled beams; shells; hygrothermal stresses and strains; finite element formulation; and failure criteria. More than 300 illustrations, 50 fully worked problems, and material properties data sets are included. Some knowledge of composites, differential equations, and matrix algebra is helpful but not necessary, as the book is self-contained. Graduate students, researchers, and practitioners will value it for both theory and application.	{"authors": ["/authors/OL6820641A"], "subjects": ["Engineering", "Nonfiction", "Composite materials", "Materials, mechanical properties", "Mechanical properties", "Composites", "Propri\u00e9t\u00e9s m\u00e9caniques", "TECHNOLOGY & ENGINEERING", "Structural", "Estruturas", "Propriedades mec\u00e2nicas"], "covers": [6448543]}

/works/OL15278362W	La Economía Mundial	|Introducción
La economía mundial, título general de este libro, ¿existe como tal? La organización de la actividad económica en el mundo contemporáneo, ¿es una suma o yuxtaposición de las diversas economías nacionales o forma un todo coherente, una auténtica organización económica del conjunto de naciones del planeta? Es éste un problema teórico de primera magnitud que ha ocupado la atención de economistas y políticos durante muchas décadas, sin que se hayan alcanzado aún conclusiones definitivas.
Es evidente que, por ejemplo, una decisión de inversión adoptada por una empresa multinacional de Nueva York puede tener, y tiene, repercusiones en otros países. Si se trata de una inversión productiva en un país africano, se crearán puestos de trabajo, aparecerán nuevas rentas salariales, aumentarán el consumo autónomo de productos, el comercio exterior y los movimientos de capitales, etc. En este ejemplo, típico de nuestros días, podemos observar la existencia de formas concretas de interrelación económica que ligan unas economías a otras. Sin embargo, la persistencia de economías nacionales también es evidente: políticas de desarrollo nacional, protección a la industria del país, aranceles, fomento de la exportación, restricción de la inversión extranjera, etc. Existen, pues, formas de organización específicamente internacional del capital.
Este fenómeno, que se manifiesta claramente en los países de tipo capitalista, ¿aparece también en los Estados socialistas?, ¿puede hablarse de economía socialista integrada o de economías socialistas nacionales ?
Esta diversidad, capitalismo-socialismo, desarrollo-subdesarrollo, metrópoli-colonia, centro-periferia, nos muestra claramente que no todas las economías nacionales son estructuralmente iguales o semejantes; pero no nos dice nada acerca de la existencia o no de una economía mundial.
Esta hay que entenderla como una estructura de relaciones de producción y distribución que afecta a todos los países del mundo, situándolos en un lugar u otro dentro de esta estructura, ya sea como países dependientes o colonizadores, capitalistas o socialistas, etc., y en el marco histórico concreto en que hoy vivimos; en un mundo dividido por motivos no sólo de índole económica —grado de desarrollo de las fuerzas productivas—, sino también militar, política y social, donde las luchas de clases y de liberación nacional, los enfrentamientos entre bloques, etc., ocupan un lugar destacado y determinan la orientación económica de un país en un sentido u otro.|	{"authors": ["/authors/OL6823216A"], "subjects": ["econom\u00eda", "economics"], "covers": [6455614]}

The Hunting For Bears marriage data collection as of about 1980, was the world's largest collection of U.S. marriage records in private hands. Eighteen states of data were availble for surname searches and were offered for sale on CDs in conjunction with Automated Archives(c).

Family Tree Maker(c) personal genealogy software bundled the H.F.B. marriage data with their product and sold tens of thousands of the various packages. The H.F.B. marriage data was crucial in making FTM(c) the most popular genealogical software in the world.

The same collection was included in Ancestry.com's(c) initial data searches, playing a significant role in its rise to the world's premier genealogy data search engine.

That was the 1980 collection, the 2010 collection dwarfs it in comparison. This book is part of that 2010 collection. It is maintained in a data base structure to provide the highest information density. Each marriage is contained in one line. Each party in the union is included in the alphabetical listing. Using the records in a database format and listing both participants in the alphabetical sort was so unique in 1960 that the U.S. Government has granted Hunting For Bears a (c)copyright on the collection in both print and later electronic and microform format.

Several things we are considering in the immediate future are; e_books to buy, loan or free downloads, books available through instant publication, and books on line.

Oh, the name and logo, Russell, as Nick was called in his youth, loved puns. The newspaper genealogy column that he began writing in 1951, Hunting Your Forebears, quickly became Hunting For Bears and the bear and hunter logo was created.

When available, record location information such as county book and page number may be included as well as age, birth or death dates, race, gender and information about prior marriages.|	{"authors": ["/authors/OL987399A"], "subjects": ["North Carolina Marriage Records", "Marriage Records", "Genealogy", "North Carolina Marriages", "North Carolina vital records", "vital records", "NC vital records", "hfbnc", "hfb", "North Carolina Genealogy", "Southern Heritage", "North Carolina Ancestry", "North Carolina Archives", "North Carolina Roots", "North Carolina Grooms", "North Carolina Brides", "NC Genealogy", "NC Archives", "NC Roots", "NC Grooms", "NC Brides", "NC", "N.C."], "covers": [6591608, 6591608]}

/works/OL15437767W	“Government of British India on Allama Mashraqi and Khaksar Tehreek (Movement)	|Synopsis:
An unprecedented academic undertaking toward the Indian sub-continent’s history, this landmark publication presents a timeline of the Government of British India’s materials as well as historically important events and news, relevant to Mashraqi and his Khaksar Tehreek (Khaksar Movement). It contains descriptive information on the secret and private correspondence of the Secretary of State for India, Viceroy of India, Provincial Governors, and other high officials. It also includes descriptions of classified and confidential documents and intelligence and Provincial Governors’ fortnightly reports.

This work is among the most comprehensive chronologies ever created on the subject and caters to researchers, historians, educators, authors, journalists, students, movie/documentary makers, and the like. It is complimentary to the other chronologies already published by the editor and should be used in conjunction with those works: 

(1) Pakistan’s Freedom & Allama Mashriqi: Statements, Letters, Chronology of Khaksar Tehrik (Movement), Period: Mashriqi’s Birth to 1947. 

(2) Pakistan’s Birth & Allama Mashraqi: Chronology & Statements, Period: 1947 – 1963. 

For additional information about Allama Mashraqi, visit: http://www.allamamashraqi.com

About the Editor:

Nasim Yousaf, a grandson of Allama Mashraqi, is a historian and scholar; his exhaustive research focuses on Mashraqi and the Khaksar Tehreek (Khaksar Movement). Coming from a famous political family of Pakistan, he also brings to his works inside knowledge and deep insight into the politics of the Indian-subcontinent. Additionally, his interactions (while in the USA and abroad) with many cultures and keen interest in the histories and politics of various societies have contributed to his perspective on world politics.

The editor’s knowledge of Mashraqi’s struggle comes not only from his far-reaching research, but also from his discussions with Mashraqi’s sons and daughters (who were part of the struggle), other family members, and Mashraqi’s followers and admirers. Further, Mr. Yousaf had the honor of observing Mashraqi from a close distance. The editor saw Mashraqi in many key moments: addressing the crowd, with the masses’ love and dedication toward their leader on display, behind bars and under house-arrest, and in his last days and at a heart-breaking event, Mashraqi’s funeral. Mr. Yousaf has written extensively on Allama Mashraqi and his Movement; he has presented papers at conferences in the USA. His academic
piece published in “Harvard Asia Quarterly” (Spring 2009) challenges the traditionally held belief that the partition of British India was inevitable and exposes a complex picture of the partition episode.

These works have changed the complexion of the current history of the Indian sub-continent and have added a new dimension to the independence episode. His research has compelled historians to revisit the history of the region and correct the fabrication and elimination of many important facts.

The editor’s works on Allama Mashraqi and the Khaksar Movement are a vital resource for faculty, researchers, journalists, students, film/documentary producers, and general interest readers to learn about Mashraqi and his pivotal role in bringing freedom to British India.

/works/OL15455920W	Ist keine Antwort auch eine Antwort?	Umfragen beeinflussen unsere Vorstellung von der Welt, da sie eine der wenigen Möglichkeiten sind, latente soziale Phänomene - z.B. politische Einstellungen und Verhaltensabsichten - zu messen. Sie bieten jedoch nur dann ein realistisches Abbild, wenn sie gewisse Qualitätskriterien erfüllen und systematische Verzerrungen vermieden werden. Mit diesem Problem beschäftigt sich das vorliegende Buch und untersucht dabei eine ganz bestimmte Fehlerquelle von Umfragen: Diejenigen Personen, die eine Teilnahme bewusst verweigern. In einer großen quantitativ-empirischen Studie wird versucht, sich dem Paradoxon, diejenigen zu befragen, die sich nicht befragen lassen, anzunähern.

The book considers the implications of the EC's investor protection rules 'on the books' but also considers investor protection law and policy 'in action', drawing on experience from the UK retail market and in particular the Financial Services Authority's extensive retail market activities, including the recent Retail Distribution Review and the Treating Customers Fairly strategy"--Provided by publisher.	{"authors": ["/authors/OL1520666A"], "subjects": ["Government policy", "Investments", "Investments, law and legislation", "Investments, europe", "Investments, great britain"]}

/works/OL15506512W	Ultimate tough guy	When Jim Jeffries won the heavyweight title in 1899, boxers were the most celebrated athletes in America. Icons John L. Sullivan and Gentleman Jim Corbett had preceded him, but Jeffries seemed to be of a different breed--big, strong, and almost freakishly athletic, with the ruggedness of the grizzly bears he hunted on his trips into the wilderness. Big Jim was a brand new kind of American hero, and the heavyweight era he dominated was loaded with a group of great fighters that most boxing historians rank as being unmatched until the "Golden Era" of Ali-Frazier-Foreman in the 1970's. Tearing through his opponents with the ferocity of a force of nature, Jeffries retired undefeated in 1904, but was reluctantly lured back into the ring six years later to take on the first black heavyweight champion, Jack Johnson, in what was arguably the most controversial sporting event in American history.--From publisher description.	{"authors": ["/authors/OL6857411A"], "subjects": ["Boxers (Sports)", "Biography"]}
